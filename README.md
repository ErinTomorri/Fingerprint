# Fingerprint
Inspiration
Have you ever seen the show NCIS, a big portion is fingerprint scanning, we came up with the idea of such a project after being fans of the show and seeing the fingerprint on the slideshow.

What it does
You input a fingerprint of your choice, and the scanner searches a database of other fingerprints to find the one that is most similar.

How we built it
We used a python library called cv2 / OpenCV which comes with machine learning models and you used on to look through our images and compare them to each other

Challenges we ran into
We initially planned to create an 'Among Us' game, but the development process proved to be too challenging, and university supplementaries took up most of our time. As a result, we decided to switch gears and create a simpler fingerprint scanner instead. Besides that, the database took the longest to find

Accomplishments that we're proud of
How fast we did it, by looking at it you might assume that it took literal years to build but, one afternoon and we popped out this masterpiece

What we learned
Don't procrastinate!

What's next for Fingerprint scanner
There a lot we can do, we can make it recognize if its your finger like on IPhone, we can increase our database, we can make it so it scans your finger live

Run: 
1. download the database from the website below Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruizgara/socofing?resource=download
2. download opencv by opening cmd prompt and inputing the following "pip install opencv-python"
3. place main.py file inside database and run
